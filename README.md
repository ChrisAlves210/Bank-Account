# Bank Account

A simple Python project for ACS 1111 that simulates a bank account using object-oriented programming.

The project defines a `BankAccount` class with attributes for the account holder's full name, account number, balance, and an optional account type. It also implements common banking operations such as deposit, withdraw (with overdraft fee), balance inquiry, interest calculation, and printing account statements.

## Files

- `bank_account.py` - Main Python script that defines the `BankAccount` class and demonstrates its usage with several example accounts, including the required "Mitchell" account scenario.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. In a terminal, navigate to this project folder.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python bank_account.py
   ```

You should see example outputs for multiple accounts, including deposits, withdrawals, interest being added, and account statements.
